This project is a web app allowing you to fetch informations about plants from an API and add them to your invertory. The main use of it would then be to manage plants you have at home, but you can still lie for the purpose of entertainment.<br>
The program's based on your browser's storage, not an actual server. It will <b>not</b> give you reminders after a given time without fulfilling your plants' needs yet.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
